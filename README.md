Tech Task: Frontend Developer

Created a table, filled with data from randomuser.me.
The table is filterable by country names.
A link to the openstreetmap location of random-user is provided.

I tried to implement a map view with Leaflet, but with react 18.0.0, Leaflet wasn't working.
I was able to circumvent the issues but exceeded the time limit in order to implement it. My quick fix was
to provide a link to openstreetmap.

The instruction 'Required Data from https://randomuser.me/api' on the task sheet wasn't clear to me,
so I provided the url request to randomuser.me beneath the table.

I really hope this work is kind of satisfying the expectations. I would be very happy to hear from you!
